# Speech-Transformer
PyTorch implementation of Speech Transformer, CNN Extractor (ds2 / vgg) + Transformer.    
I implemented this repo by referring to several repositories.  
I appreciate any kind of [feedback or contribution](https://github.com/sooftware/Speech-Transformer/issues)

This repository focused on implementing transomers that are specialized in speech recognition.  
while at the same time striving for a readable code. To improve readability,  
I designed the model structure to fit as much as possible to the blocks in the above Transformers figure.
